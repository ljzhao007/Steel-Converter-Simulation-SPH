# Steel-Converter-Simulation-SPH

This is CFD simulation using Smoothed Particle Hydronamics programmed in C++.
It was made back in 2012, when I was a very green programmer and didn't know about git and many other things.
Please read SPH_Report.pdf for a detailed summary of this project and its objectives
